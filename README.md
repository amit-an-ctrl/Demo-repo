# Demo-repo
So this is how it is done 

Yes this is it at last I am able to do it as I wish 

But it is not updated now 
first you have to add a file which is git add --all or git add filename 

then you have to commit it by git commit -m "the message"

then you have to git pull upstream main 

then you have to git push origin main 

then you can ofcourse check the status by git status 

in case you get a message that your process in running in the background type this del .git\index.lock
